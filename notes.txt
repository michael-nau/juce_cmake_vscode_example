Need to make AudioProcessorValueTreeState
- this is the container that holds all the parameters for the GUI

processBlock is where we do all the dsp

If you want a sharper slope you need to make a chain of filters
- define a ProcessorChain
- pass in a ProcessContext

To run and debug
- Run audioPluginHost to pass in signal (filtergraph is setup)
- Do this by running command 'Run Build Task' is vscode - it will launch
